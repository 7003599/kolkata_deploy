    <img src="file:///C:/Users/KRISHNENDU%20GHOSH/Pictures/Kolkata_Imgs.jpg" width="500" height="300">
    <p>The 'City of Joy' earned its nickname because of its unfettered enthusiasm for its culture, traditions, literature, history, food and more. Kolkata is the perfect amalgamation of old-world charm and modern India.Kolkata (spelled Calcutta before 1 January 2001) is the capital city of the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the second largest city in India after Mumbai.[2] It is on the east bank of the River Hooghly.[3] When it is called Calcutta, it includes the suburbs. This makes it the third largest city of India. This also makes it the world's 8th largest metropolitan area as defined by the United Nations.[4] Kolkata served as the capital of India during the British Raj until 1911. Kolkata was once the center of industry and education. However, it has witnessed political violence and economic problems since 1954. Since 2000, Kolkata has grown due to economic growth. Like other metropolitan cities in India, Kolkata struggles with poverty, pollution and traffic congestion.</p>
